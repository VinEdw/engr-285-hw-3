= Problem 1

Write a program that utilizes a while-loop to return the square root of an arbitrary positive number to the nearest whole number; i.e. find the largest integer whoâ€™s square is less than the given number, and compare to the square of the next integer.
Do not use any non-elementary math operations (i.e. the only math operations you can use are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
Test your code with several numbers of various sizes to check that it is working properly.
Write out or copy/paste the code.

= Problem 2

One of the simplest ways to numerically calculate definite integrals is with Monte Carlo integration.
Write a program that will approximately integrate the function $f(x) = e^(-1/2 x^2)$ from $0 < x < 1$ by choosing 100 points $(x, y)$ in the square $0 < x < 1$ and $0 < y < 1$ with random coordinates, counting how many of them lie under the curve, and dividing by the total number of points.
Write out or copy/paste the code.
Run your program 6 times and record the
outcomes.

= Problem 3

For each of the following initial value problems, solve using the Euler Method and either sketch or copy/paste a graph of the result over the given interval.
Use a step size small enough that continuing to lower the step size further yields no noticeable change in the appearance of the graph.

= Problem 4

For each of the following initial value problems, first solve for $y(x)$ by separating the equation.
Then use the Euler Method to determine an estimate for the maximum step size such that $y(4)$ is accurate to less than 1%.
(i.e. run an Euler Method program repeatedly, decreasing step size each time, until the calculated value of $y(4)$ is less than 1% different from the exact answer)

== Part a

$2y' = tan y$ subject to $y(0) = 0.05$

$2y' &= tan(y) \
(d y)/(d x) &= 1/2 tan(y) \
(d y)/(tan(y)) &= 1/2 d x \
integral cot(y) d y &= integral 1/2 d x \
ln(sin(y)) &= 1/2 x + C \
sin(y) &= C e^(1/2 x) \
y &= sin^(-1)(C e^(1/2 x)) \
$

$underline(y(0) = 0.05) \
0.05 &= sin^(-1)(C e^(1/2 (0))) \
C &= sin(0.05) \
$

$y &= sin^(-1)(sin(0.05) e^(1/2 x)) \
y(4) &= sin^(-1)(sin(0.05) e^(1/2 (4))) \

$6 y y' = x sin(y^2)$ subject to $y(0) = 1.5$

$6 y y' &= x sin(y^2) \
(d y)/(d x) &= (x sin(y^2)) / (6 y) \
y / sin(y^2) d y &= x / 6 d x \
integral y / sin(y^2) d y &= integral x / 6 d x \
integral y csc(y^2) d y &= integral x / 6 d x \
-1/2 sinh^(-1)(cot(y^2)) &= 1/12 x^2 + C \
sinh^(-1)(cot(y^2)) &= -1/6 x^2 + C \
cot(y^2) &= sinh(-1/6 x^2 + C) \
y^2 &= cot^(-1)[sinh(C - 1/6 x^2)] \
y &= plus.minus sqrt(cot^(-1)[sinh(C - 1/6 x^2)]) \
y &= sqrt(cot^(-1)[sinh(C - 1/6 x^2)]) \
$

$underline(y(0) = 1.5) \
1.5 &= plus.minus sqrt(cot^(-1)[sinh(C - 1/6 (0)^2)]) \
2.25 &= cot^(-1)[sinh(C)] \
cot(2.25) &= sinh(C) \
C &= sinh^(-1)(cot(2.25)) \

= Problem 5

Error in the Euler Method is difficult to conceptualize outside of physical contexts;
in this problem we will look at the degree of the violation of energy conservation present in Euler solutions of a simple spring-mass system.
Consider the system
$
(d x)/(d t) = v quad "and" quad (d v)/(d t) = -k/m x
$
We'll choose $m = 1$ and $k = pi^2$ so that the period should be $T = 2$.

  + Plot the trajectory of the mass over time $0 < t < 4$ with the initial conditions $x(0) = 1$ and $v(0) = 0$ for several different step sizes between 0.001 and 0.1.
    Describe how you can tell visually from the trajectories whether there is significant error in the calculation, and describe how the magnitude of that error appears to change when the step size increases.
  + The energy of the spring-mass system is given by
    $ E(t) = 1/2 m [v(t)]^2 + 1/2 k [x(t)]^2 $
    and theoretically should not change in time; i.e. $E(t) = E(0)$.
    Add code to your program from part (a) to additionally calculate $E(t)$ and plot it as a function of time $0 < t < 4$ for three different step sizes between 0.001 and 0.1.
    Comment on any trends that you observe.

}

The total energy of the system, and thus the amplitude, are supposed to remain constant.
If the amplitude increases or decreases over time, then the total energy must be increasing or decreasing, which should not happen.

In the position vs time graphs, the amplitude increases over time, indicating that the energy must be increasing too.
There must be some error in the calculations using the Euler Method.
The effect is more pronounced for larger step sizes ($h$).
Larger step sizes lead to larger changes in amplitude and total energy.
In other words, decreasing the step size reduces the error.

Looking at the energy vs time graphs, the energy increases over time at an increasing rate.
An increase in energy was expected on account of the increase in amplitude.
Since the energy changes continuously, a boost in energy is gained on each iteration of the Euler Method, 
Thus, each iteration accumulates some error.

= Problem 6

Air resistance is notoriously difficult to model;
as it turns out the most accurate models of air resistance are complicated functions of the speed.
Consider a more general air resistance model, where we take the friction force to be proportional to the speed to an arbitrary power $alpha$:
$
(d v)/(d t) = -g - k v|v|^(alpha - 1)
$
We would ultimately like to compare the maximum height achieved by vertically thrown objects as we vary $alpha$.

== Part a

In order to compare these air resistance models, we should choose the proportionality constants so that the models have the same _terminal speed_ (i.e. the speed at which a _dropped_ object will not change its velocity; $(d v)/(d t) = 0$).
Express the proportionality constant $k$ in terms of the terminal speed $v_oo$, the power $alpha$, and $g$.

$(d v)/(d t) = 0 "when" v = -v_oo \
0 = -g - k (-v_oo)|-v_oo|^(alpha - 1) \
g = k v_oo (v_oo)^(alpha - 1) \
g = k (v_oo)^alpha \
k = g / (v_oo)^alpha \
$

  + From here we will work in units of time where $g = 1$ and units of distance where $v_oo = 1$ for convenience.
    Write a program using the vector Euler Method that will determine the maximum height achieved by a vertically thrown object.
    Choose a value for $v_0$ such that $0 < v_0 < 1$ and record the maximum height for 5 different values of $alpha$ such that $1 < alpha < 2$.
  + Repeat the previous part for a different value of $v_0$ such that $v_0 > 1$.
